The project involved setting up a population of bots, breeding them, and evaluating their fitness in order to evolve a population that can successfully navigate a maze.
Key Learnings: Creating a population manager in Unity using genetic algorithms Implementing fitness functions in genetic algorithms Managing data structures using lists in C# Applying good coding practices, such as commenting and using informative variable names Testing and experimenting with different parameters to fine-tune the genetic algorithm and improve the quality of the solutions it generates.</description></item><item><title>Lost in the forest in Unreal Engine</title><link>https://meruman.github.io/posts/12.-lost_in_the_forest/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Feb 2023 10:58:43 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://meruman.github.io/posts/12.-lost_in_the_forest/</guid><description>Description: 2D/3D environment gameplay concept to practice this mix of dimension space.
