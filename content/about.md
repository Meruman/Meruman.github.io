            <!-- <p style="font-size: medium; line-height: 130%; text-align: center;">I am a passionate and dedicated game developer with over 5 years of experience in software development and data science. I see myself as a curious and proactive guy who loves to try new things in life, whether it's experiencing different cultures, trying new food, or exploring the latest technology trends in game development.
                <br><br>
                    My expertise in object-oriented programming, optimization, and machine learning algorithms, as well as my proficiency in programming languages such as C#, Python, C++, and Blueprints visual scripting, make me a valuable asset to any game development team. I'm particularly excited about the opportunity to work with a company that is utilizing AI and machine learning in game development.
                    <br><br>
                    In addition to my technical skills, I also have experience managing databases, creating scripts to retrieve data using Python and SQL, and developing web scrapers for products. I have also conducted practical workshops on fundamental algorithms and data structures, Java programming, and principles of object-oriented programming.
                    <br><br>
                    When I'm not working on games, you can find me climbing, watching series, or researching new technology to add to my game development workflow. I'm always eager to learn and improve my skills, and I'm super excited to develop new games and bring my ideas to life.
                    <br><br>
                    I look forward to the opportunity to work on projects that shares my passion for game development and technology.</p> -->
