### **Project Overview** 

-   Name: Sea Monsters Assault

-   Type: 2D game

-   Platform: PC

-   Tools: Python, Pygame, Stable diffusion

### **Description**

Sea Monsters Assault is a 2D game where the player defends their beach from waves of sea monsters. The player must shoot down the monsters before they reach the shore, while avoiding their attacks. The game features multiple rounds of increasing difficulty, with new types of monsters. The game's graphics are generated using Stable diffusion, an AI-powered image generation tool.
       
### **Goals and Objectives**

The main goal of the project was to create a fun and challenging game using Python and Pygame, while showcasing the potential of AI-generated graphics. The objectives were to implement the game mechanics, design and generate the game's graphics using Stable diffusion, and add sound and music effects to enhance the gameplay experience.

### **Tools and Technologies Used:**

-   Python
-   Pygbag
-   Visual studio code
-   Stable diffusion

### **Development Process**

The development process involved several stages, starting with the initial concept and design, followed by the implementation of the game mechanics and logic, the integration of Stable diffusion graphics, and the addition of sound and music effects.

### **Design and Art**

The game's design and art were created using Stable diffusion, an AI-powered image generation tool that uses machine learning to generate images from textual descriptions. The tool allowed me to create a wide variety of sea monsters and beach scenery, with different colors, shapes, and sizes, while minimizing the need for manual illustration. This approach saved time and resources while achieving a unique and visually appealing style for the game.

### **Programming**

The game was programmed using Python and Pygame, a popular game development library for Python. The code includes various functions, classes, and objects to handle the game mechanics and logic. The Pygbag library was used to port the game into itch-io and be able to play the game directly in the web browser.

### **Sound and Music**

The game features sound and music effects that enhance the gameplay experience and create a more immersive environment. The sound effects include monster roars, bullet shots, and explosions, while the music sets the mood and pace of the game. The audio files were sourced from royalty-free libraries and edited to fit the game's theme and tone.

### **Future Plans**

The game can be further developed and expanded with additional features and content, such as new types of monsters, power-ups, and challenges. The game's AI-generated graphics can also be improved and diversified by training the Stable diffusion model with a specific art style.
