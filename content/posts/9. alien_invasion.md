### **Description:** 

 I'm thrilled to present this game development project, a top-down shooter game made in Unity. The unique aspect of this project is that all the image assets were generated by Stable difussion and the plot was created by ChatGPT. The purpose of this project is to showcase how efficient and productive AI tools can be when used in game development.

### **Concept and Design**

The game's concept is centered around an alien invasion on a distant planet. Players take on the role of a space explorer who must collect valuable resources while fending off hostile aliens. The player character is a humanoid in a space suit, while the aliens come in various sizes and shapes, each with their own unique attack patterns. The player has a selection of weapons at their disposal, including a plasma rifle, flamethrower, and EMP gun.
       
### **Tools and Technologies Used**

To create this project, I used Unity as the game engine and GIMP to modify the image assets generated by DallE. ChatGPT was used to provide guidance and feedback throughout the development process.

### **Goals and Objectives**

The primary goal of this project is to create a functional and engaging top-down shooter game that showcases the efficient use of AI tools in game development. I aimed to create a game that provides a challenging and enjoyable experience for players as they navigate through different terrains and battle various types of aliens to ultimately defeat the Big Boss Alien.

### **Development Process**

I began by creating a game design document (GDD) to outline the game's concept, objectives, and mechanics. The image assets were generated using DallE and modified with GIMP to fit the game's design. Unity was used to create the game's mechanics, UI, and overall functionality. ChatGPT was used to provide guidance and feedback throughout the development process.

### **Art and Sound**

The game features a visually stunning art style that includes all image assets generated by DallE and modified with GIMP. Sound effects and music were added to enhance the overall gameplay experience.

### **Gameplay and Demo**

The gameplay involves the player navigating through different terrains and battling various types of aliens to reach the ultimate goal of defeating the Big Boss Alien. The game includes weapon power-ups and health drops, adding an extra strategic element to the gameplay. A demo version of the game is available to showcase the game's mechanics and overall design.

### **Skills learned**

Throughout the development of this project, I gained valuable skills in game design, Unity development, image asset modification using GIMP, and efficient use of AI tools for game development.

### **Future Plans**

Future plans for the game may include adding additional levels, characters, and weapons power-ups to enhance the player's experience. Additionally, adding multiplayer capabilities could make the game more engaging for players. I also look forward to exploring the use of other AI tools for game development in my future projects.
