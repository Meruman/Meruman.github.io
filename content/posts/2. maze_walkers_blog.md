### Introduction

Genetic algorithms are a powerful tool for finding solutions to complex problems. They work by simulating the process of natural selection, using a combination of mutation and crossover to create a new generation of solutions that is better than the previous generation. In this project, we will use genetic algorithms to create a maze walking solution in Unity. We will create a population of bots, each with its own unique DNA, and evolve that population over time until we have a group of bots that can successfully navigate a maze.

### Setting up the population manager script

The first thing we need to do is set up the link library at the top of the script. We'll then declare public game objects for the bot prefab and starting position. Population size is set to 50, and a list is created to hold the population. Public static elapsed time and trial time variables are created, along with a GUI to print the generation count, how far the generation has run, and the population count.

### Creating the Population

The start function loops through and creates the population by instantiating the bot prefab at the starting position and adding the bot to the population list. Each bot has a DNA component, which contains an array of floats representing the bot's neural network weights. We use a simple neural network with three input nodes, two hidden nodes, and two output nodes to control the bot's movement.

### Breeding the Population

The breed function creates an offspring from two parents, sets up the offspring's brain, and mutates its DNA. We use a simple crossover algorithm to combine the parents' DNA and a mutation rate to randomly modify the DNA. Breed new population orders the population by the distance traveled and then breeds the top half with everyone else in the top half and adds the children to the population.

### Fine-tuning the genetic algorithm

The fitness function is used to evaluate the performance of each bot in the population, and determine which individuals should be selected for breeding in the next generation. In this context, we use the distance traveled by the bot as the fitness score. We calculate the distance between the bot's current position and the target position in the maze, and use this value to update the bot's fitness score.

### Updating the Population

The update function ticks around for the elapsed time until it reaches the end of the trial time, brings the population, and starts all over again. We use Unity's built-in coroutine feature to wait for a specified amount of time before restarting the trial. This allows us to evaluate each bot's fitness over a fixed period of time, rather than simply measuring the distance traveled in a single frame.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, we've created a population manager in Unity for a maze walking solution using genetic algorithms. The code provides a good example of how to set up a population of bots, breed them, and evaluate their fitness in order to evolve a population that can successfully navigate a maze. We've also seen the importance of fitness functions in genetic algorithms, the use of lists in C# to manage data structures, and the value of good coding practices and testing your code. By experimenting with different parameters and fine-tuning our genetic algorithm, we can improve the quality of the solutions it generates and apply this knowledge to other complex problems.
