### **Description:** 

For this project, I developed a Unity Pong game where a human player can play against an artificial pong paddle that is trained with an artificial neural network. The game involves bouncing a ball back and forth between two paddles, and the objective is to score points by getting the ball past the opponent's paddle. The artificial paddle is able to learn and improve its performance over time through the use of a neural network, making it a challenging opponent for players to face.

### **Key Skills Demonstrated:**

-   Game development using Unity engine
-   Implementation of artificial intelligence techniques, specifically neural networks
-   Object-oriented programming principles
-   Problem-solving and debugging skills
       
### **Tools and Technologies Used:**

-   Unity game engine
-   C# programming language
-   Visual Studio code editor


### **Details:**

The game consists of three main classes: Brain, HumanPlayer, and MoveBall. The Brain class contains the neural network that controls the movement of the artificial paddle. The HumanPlayer class allows a human player to control the other paddle using keyboard input. The MoveBall class handles the movement of the ball and collision detection with the paddles and walls.

The neural network used in the game is a simple feedforward network with one hidden layer. It takes in the current position of the ball and the paddle, as well as their velocities, as input, and outputs a prediction for the vertical movement of the paddle. The weights of the neural network are updated using backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent during each training episode.

During gameplay, the artificial paddle starts out with random weights and learns through trial and error as it plays against the human player. The performance of the paddle is evaluated based on the number of points it scores against the human player, and the weights are updated accordingly. As the paddle trains, it becomes progressively more skilled at the game, providing a challenging opponent for the human player.

### **Outcome:**

The resulting game is a fun and engaging way for players to test their skills against an AI opponent. The use of a neural network to train the artificial paddle allows for a challenging opponent that adapts and improves over time, providing an exciting and dynamic gameplay experience. The project also demonstrates proficiency in game development and AI techniques.

### **Future Improvements:**

There are several ways that this project could be expanded and improved in the future. Some potential areas for enhancement include:

-   Adding additional layers to the neural network to improve performance
-   Implementing more advanced AI techniques, such as reinforcement learning or genetic algorithms
-   Adding additional features to the game, such as power-ups or obstacles, to make gameplay more varied and interesting.
