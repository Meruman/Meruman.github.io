### **Introduction**

The Flappy Bird game has been an inspiration for many developers to create their version of it. In this blog, we will explore how to create a Flappy Bird-inspired game using genetic algorithms and 2D collider in Unity. We will learn about the genetic algorithm, 2D collider, raycasting, fitness function, debugging tools, and object-oriented programming.

### **Genetic Algorithm for Machine Learning**

Genetic algorithm is a machine learning technique that is inspired by the process of natural selection. In this code, multiple birds are created, and each bird has its own gene sequence. The birds that perform the best, i.e., get the farthest through the obstacle course, are considered the fittest and bred together. This process is repeated for several generations, and gradually the birds learn to navigate through the obstacle course.

### **2D Collider and Raycasting in Unity**

In Unity, a 2D collider is used to detect collisions between game objects in a 2D space. In this code, each sprite is given a tag to differentiate between top, bottom, dead, up wall, and down wall. Raycasting is used to detect if the bird has hit any walls. The program casts rays in the forward, upward, and downward directions to detect if the bird has hit anything, and if it does, it checks if it is an up or down wall.

### **Fitness Function in Genetic Algorithm**

The fitness function is used to evaluate the performance of each bird in the population. In this code, the fitness function is calculated based on the distance traveled and the number of crashes. The birds that travel the farthest and crash less are considered the fittest and are selected for breeding.

### **Debugging Tools in Unity**

Unity provides various debugging tools to visualize the raycasts and collisions. In this code, Unity's debugging tools are used to visualize the raycasts and collisions. This helps in identifying any issues with the code and fixing them quickly.

### **Object-oriented Programming**

The code is written in an object-oriented style, with different classes for the bird, population, and genetic algorithm. This structure helps in organizing the code in a maintainable way and making it easier to add new features to the game.

### **Conclusion**

In conclusion, we learned about genetic algorithms and how they can be used for machine learning tasks. We also learned about 2D collider, raycasting, fitness function, debugging tools, and object-oriented programming in Unity. These concepts can be applied to various game development and machine learning tasks.
