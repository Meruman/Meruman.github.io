### **Introduction**

In this blog, we will explore how to use genetic algorithms to train a bird to navigate through an obstacle course without crashing into walls. We will use Unity to create a 2D game inspired by Flappy Birds.

### **What are Genetic Algorithms?**

Genetic algorithms are a type of machine learning that is based on the principles of natural selection. In genetic algorithms, we create a population of potential solutions, and then we evaluate the fitness of each solution based on a fitness function. The fittest solutions are then selected to reproduce, and their genetic material is combined to create new solutions. This process is repeated over multiple generations, with the hope that the population will evolve to find the optimal solution to the problem.

### **Setting up the Obstacle Course**

To set up the obstacle course, we use sprites and box colliders in Unity. Each sprite is given a tag to differentiate between top, bottom, dead, up wall, and down wall. The birds must navigate through the course without hitting any walls. The goal is for the birds to get through the obstacle course, and the fitness value is based on the distance traveled by the birds.

### **Using 2D Colliders and Raycasting in Unity**

We use 2D colliders to detect if the bird has hit any walls and a Boolean value to determine if the bird is alive. The program casts rays in the forward, upward, and downward directions to detect if the bird has hit anything, and if it does, it checks if it is an up or down wall. This allows the program to determine if the bird has hit the top or bottom of the wall and adjust the movement accordingly.

### **Creating the Fitness Function**

The fitness function is calculated based on the distance traveled and the number of crashes. The program records the start position of the bird and updates the position and collider of the bird. If the bird hits any walls, the Boolean value is set to false, and the fitness function is adjusted accordingly. The fittest birds are then selected to reproduce and create the next generation of birds.

### **Debugging Tools in Unity**

Unity provides various debugging tools to visualize the raycasts and collisions. In this code, Unity's debugging tools are used to visualize the raycasts and collisions. This helps in identifying any issues with the code and fixing them quickly.

### **Object-Oriented Programming in Unity**

The code is written in an object-oriented style, with different classes for the bird, population, and genetic algorithm. This allows the code to be organized and maintainable, making it easier to add new features or make changes down the line.

### **Conclusion**

In this blog, we have explored how to use genetic algorithms to train a bird to navigate through an obstacle course in Unity. We have covered the basics of genetic algorithms, how to set up an obstacle course, and how to use 2D colliders and raycasting in Unity. We have also looked at how to create a fitness function, use debugging tools, and write object-oriented code. By understanding these concepts, you will be able to create more complex games and applications using Unity and genetic algorithms.
